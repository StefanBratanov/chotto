Chotto can be used to participate in the KZG Ceremony which will
bring [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) to life. It is an Ethereum's Powers of Tau
(PoT) client CLI implementation written in Java. It follows the spec defined in
the [KZG ceremony specs](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-specs).

üïØÔ∏èüïØÔ∏èüïØÔ∏è **The KZG Ceremony is live** and the url of the `sequencer`
is https://seq.ceremony.ethereum.org. Check
the [Install Instructions](#install-instructions) and [Usage](#usage) to see how to use Chotto
to contribute. After contributing, you can check your
contribution [here](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/#/record). üïØÔ∏èüïØÔ∏èüïØÔ∏è

## Install Instructions

### Install Prerequisites

- Java 11+

### Binary Releases

Binary releases are available from
the [releases page](https://github.com/StefanBratanov/chotto/releases).

Once downloaded and unzipped, executables will be available in the `bin/` folder.

### Manual Build

You can also manually build the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StefanBratanov/chotto.git
cd chotto
./gradlew installDist
```

This will install ready to use executables in the `build/install/chotto/bin` folder.

## Generating randomness

Generating randomness is an important part of the KZG Ceremony. Each participant needs to generate 4
different random secrets. The user should not have a knowledge of these generated values and also
all secrets should be wiped out from memory after the contribution is complete. The way each random
secret is generated in Chotto is as follows:

* User provides an entropy of at least 6 characters when starting the client.
* An IKM (input keying material) with 256 bytes is initialised with the entropy bytes. (truncated or padded with
  zeros)
* Half or more bytes (128 or 256 minus the length of the entropy) are replaced by random bytes. (
  based on
  `java.security.SecureRandom`)
* The IKM is passed to a [BLS KeyGen](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-specs/blob/master/docs/cryptography/BLS.md#keygen) function which ultimately generates
  the secret.

The secrets will only live in the Java process, so won't be exposed when the browser is opened for
logging in and signing the contribution. After the
Java process is terminated, all secrets will be wiped out from memory.

## Usage

Required arguments:

* `sequencer`

See [CLI Arguments](#cli-arguments) for all available arguments.

### Sample Usage

Note: For Windows, use the `chotto.bat` executable.

#### Authenticate with Ethereum

```bash
./chotto --sequencer=https://seq.ceremony.ethereum.org/
```

#### Authenticate with GitHub

```bash
./chotto --sequencer=https://seq.ceremony.ethereum.org/ --authentication=github
```

#### Run against a local sequencer

```bash
./chotto --sequencer=http://localhost:3000/
```

You can start a local sequencer by following the setup instructions
at [KZG Ceremony Rest API](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-sequencer).
